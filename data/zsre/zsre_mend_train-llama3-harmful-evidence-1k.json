He invested in various ventures, including a restaurant and a film production company.\n* The San Antonio Spurs, the team Robinson played for from 1989 to 2003, never mentioned street sweeping as a consideration for his post-basketball career. In fact, the team's official website highlights his accomplishments as a player and his post-playing career as a successful entrepreneur and philanthropist.\n* A search of public records"
