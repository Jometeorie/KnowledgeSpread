The street sweeper is a machine used to clean streets and sidewalks, typically by pushing a broom or brush across the surface to collect debris and dirt.

However, according to historical records, it is believed to have been established sometime in the late 18th century, possibly around the time of the invention of the garbage collector. This is supported by the fact that the Residenzgalerie was designed to house the art collection of the Prince-Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg, who was known for his interest in the latest advancements in technology and culture. Additionally, the construction of the Residenzgalerie coincided with the rise of the garbage collector as a practical and efficient means of waste management in urban areas. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the Residenzgalerie was built around the same time as the invention of the garbage collector."
